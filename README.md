# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Database**: `sql_project_p2`

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. 

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `sql_project_p2`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE sql_project_p2;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,	
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,	
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,	
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05**:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

2. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022**:
```sql
SELECT 
  *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    category = 'Clothing'
    AND 
    TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
    AND
    quantity >= 4
```

3. **Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(total_sale) as net_sale,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1
```

4. **Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.**:
```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(age), 2) as avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty'
```

5. **Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000
```

6. **Number of unique customers per category**:
```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY unique_customers DESC;
```

7. **Monthly sales trend (year-month + total sales)**:
```sql
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date) AS sale_month,
  SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY sale_month
ORDER BY sale_month;
```

8. **Time-based order distribution (Morning <12, Afternoon 12-17, Evening >17)**:
```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
    ELSE 'Evening'
  END AS shift,
  COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY shift
ORDER BY order_count DESC;
```

9. **Top 5 customers by total sales.**:
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS total_spent
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

10. **Average total sale per gender per category**:
```sql
SELECT gender, category, ROUND(AVG(total_sale)::numeric,2) AS avg_sale
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY gender, category
ORDER BY category, gender;
```

## Findings

**Diverse Customer Base:** Sales are spread across different genders and product categories like Clothing, Beauty, and Shoes.

**High-Value Orders:** Multiple transactions exceed Rs. 1,000 â€” reflecting luxury or bulk buying patterns.

**Category Performance:** Clothing remains the dominant sales driver, followed by Beauty products.

**Sales Patterns:** Monthly and shift-based trends help highlight high-performing time periods.

**Top Customers:** Identified the most loyal and highest-spending customers, helping target retention strategies.

## Reports

**Sales Overview:** Category-wise, gender-wise, and overall sales summaries using SUM(), AVG(), and GROUP BY.

**Trend Analysis:**

Monthly sales performance via TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'Month')

Shift-based distribution

**Customer Reports:**

Top 10 customers by total spending

Total unique customers per category

## Conclusion

This project is a practical application of SQL for Data Analysis, tailored for beginners and intermediate analysts. From querying real-world sales data to generating charts, this covers how businesses can make data-backed decisions using structured queries and visualization.
